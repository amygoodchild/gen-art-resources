like color contrast, difference and mixing")

Book: 'Color and Light: A guide for the realist painter'  
(Shared by Ben Kovach - "Seems pretty perfect. Relatively terse, lots of pictures and diagrams, and one core concept every 2-3 pages in pretty large type") 

* Book: 'Kunst der Farbe' ('The Art of Color: The Subjective Experience and Objective Rationale of Color') - Johannes Itten  
(Shared by Piter Pasma - "Apparently this is a fundamental colour theory book art students have to learn, it doesn't even have that many pictures, it's mostly text except for a few pages in the middle with colour wheels :-)"

* 'Color Wheel Part 1' - James Gurney
